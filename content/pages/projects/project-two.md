  It’s hard to imagine that I’ve that I wrote all this code by myself, probably because I worked with an entire team :) but they definitely followed my lead most of the time.

As I step into the new year, I’m excited to bring my passions for digital art, web development, and programming closer together. My digital art fuels my creativity, allowing me to design visually compelling elements that enhance user experiences.

 Having been an artist for a long time, I know how to create great visuals that captivate and communicate effectively. Programming ties it all together, giving me the tools to bring ideas to life with functionality and precision.
 
  This year, I’m focused on blending these skills to create projects that are not only visually stunning but also technically innovative, pushing boundaries and setting the tone for my journey as a creative technologist.

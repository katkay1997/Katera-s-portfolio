  A Python-based transit tracker that utilizes MTA's real-time feeds API to fetch and display live train data. The project enables users to monitor train arrivals, delays, and service updates, providing an efficient way to navigate the MTA system in real time.

This project is a Python-based transit tracker that integrates with the MTAâ€™s real-time API to provide live updates on train arrivals, delays, and service status. The tracker fetches data directly from the MTA's real-time feeds, displaying key information such as train locations, estimated arrival times, and any service disruptions.

 The core feature of the tracker is its ability to provide up-to-the-minute information, which helps users plan their commutes more efficiently. As part of the project, I also implemented filters for specific subway lines and stations, allowing users to focus on the information most relevant to their travels. To enhance the experience, I used error handling and data validation to ensure the tracker provides accurate, reliable information even during API downtime or errors.

Looking ahead, I aim to evolve this project into a personal mobile app. By leveraging similar API integration techniques, I want to create an app that not only tracks transit data but also offers personalized notifications, such as train delay alerts or route suggestions. The app will be designed with a user-friendly interface, and I plan to incorporate data visualization features, such as real-time maps of train locations and interactive station guides.

 The goal is to build a seamless experience that combines real-time data tracking with intuitive navigation, making it easier for users to plan their daily commute. This project is an exciting step toward exploring app development and refining my skills in Python, API integration, and user interface design.
